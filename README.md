NA imputing : hourly monitored PM2.5 in Seoul from 2017 to 2021

I collected hourly monitored PM2.5 in Seoul from 2017.09 to 2021.08. <br>
There are some NAs in that period. So I tried to impute NAs by using BRITS, which is an application of LSTM. <br>

I refered the article and github code provided from the authors. <br>
If you want to fill in the missing value collected from air pollutants monitoring stations, you can use this code.
